# flame-du-jour

> Translation: Flame of the Day

This small piece of code helps troubleshoot slow clojure load times.
It alters `clojure.core/load` to print load times to an output file of
stacks that that [FlameGraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph) can
turn into a pretty fire.

## Dependencies

* [Clojure](https://clojure.org)
* [FlameGraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph) must be installed separately to turn the
  stacks into a graph.
* The example in the README is with [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/), but there's nothing about the codebase
  that is Leiningen specific.

## Usage

`flame-du-jour.core/-main` takes an output-file and a code snippet to run.

If using leiningen, adding flame-du-jour to your user profile dependencies
makes it conveninent to use.

```clojure
{:user {:dependencies [[ryfow/flame-du-jour "0.1.0"]]}}
```

Then, in a project I'm working in (for example refactor-nrepl), run
the following from a command line:

```bash
% lein run -m flame-du-jour.core flames.txt "(require 'refactor-nrepl.middleware :reload-all)"
```

That should create a stacks file in current working directory named `flames.txt`.

flamegraph.pl will turn the stacks file into a flames svg.

```
% ~/oss/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl flames.txt > flames.svg
```

Most browsers support svg, so you can view it with `open -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app flames.svg`

## Naming History

I've always wanted to create a Clojure library named soup-du-jour. That name doesn't really
fit here and I don't find myself writing a lot of libraries, so you get flame-du-jour.

I also considered flaming-load. It was a hard decision, but I went with flame-du-jour.
